flutter build apk --release --split-per-abi  //command is used to create separate APK files for each target ABI (Application Binary Interface). This means that instead of producing a single APK file that includes binaries for all supported ABIs, Flutter will generate multiple APKs, each optimized for a specific ABI. This can reduce the size of the APK that users need to download and install.
flutter build apk --analyze-size --target-platform android-arm64      //ony for arm 64 apk
